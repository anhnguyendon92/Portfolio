                    <p class="lead">Born November 17, 1992. Started out on a refugee camp and 6 months later we land in Kentucky for about 2 years. My family and I moved to Seattle to be closer to family. Raised and graduated high school in West Seattle. From 2012-2017 I bounced around gym working as a sales man, it was a challenge but over a certain time it got boring and I was learninng anything. I took some time off of work due to mental health and later decided to work at a bakery called Macadons. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Same week I started at Macadon I decided to get a puppy (German Shepherd to be exact)and it was the best/worst thing I ever purchased. Learning how to make macarons and learning how to raised a puppy at the same time was probably the most fun I had in my life. Everything I do I try to be the best as I can be, the more challenging it is, the better. 6 months past by and I decied to get another dog to 1. More challenges 2. Keep myself active with two energize dogs. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Fast forward to around covid-19 came around. I felt like macadons was holding me back and I need something new and challenging, and that's when UW Boot Camp pop up on facebook, so I went for it. 2 days of back and forth calling and student loan approval I'm now back in school and I'm finally feel like I'm happy. Every class I'm learning more, and when I'm outside of class I'm coding personal, business, images slider websites on my own. Now I'm just looking forward to more knowledge of this class. </p>
