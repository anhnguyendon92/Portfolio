Instead of using bootstrap I've did my homework/website from scartch from the help with some good resources. 

From line 13-21 I've created a tag called navbar which will be my html code for the navagation on the top of my page. In my <navbar> tag I've made an <ul> list and use a href tag to link all my html files, so you can click on other pages ex: Home, Portfolio, and contacts

Line 24-31 is my #showcase which where my slight welcome to my portfolio. Made a <div class> of container where my h1 ( Header 1) will have context and a link btn to my about which is located further down on my page. 

line 34-49 #section tag where my about me would be. A little something about me , and a link to a photo of my puppy and I using a img src tag.
